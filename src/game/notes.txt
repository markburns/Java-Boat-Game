fix accelerating turns.
Fix mouse turning.
Fix enemyboat.


MouseEvent
X,Y

Calculate vector from boat.
Split into angle and velocity.
Calculate angular acceleration.
Turn until facing in that direction.
Accelerating until that speed.
about 1/4 screen = full speed acceleration

newAngle
newSpeed

find angle which is less than Math.PI

e.g.
angle 
newAngle

angular velocity = (newAngle-angle) / turnTime (in frames) about 60 i'd guess

if (angle > Math.PI)
	angle = angle-2*Math.PI

tweakVelocityFactor (only one for now)
maxSpeed

velocity
